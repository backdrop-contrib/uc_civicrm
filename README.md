# Ubercart CiviCRM

When a customer buys something from the Ubercart store, the name and address
information they provide is added to CiviCRM. If the customer has a simple
contact record generated by syncing CiviCRM from the Backdrop user table, that
record is updated with the new information. If no contact record exists, one is
created.

Then the new or updated contact is added to the 'Purchasers' group or group
selected in the admin screen. A contribution record is added to the contact's
history and the 'Purchases' tab on the contact's dashboard entry is populated
with a link to the contact's order history in Ubercart.
